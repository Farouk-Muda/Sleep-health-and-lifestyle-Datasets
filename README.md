/* Summary statistics for numerical variables */
PROC MEANS DATA=health.sleep_health N MEAN STD MIN MAX;
    VAR Age Sleep_Duration Quality_of_Sleep Physical_Activity_Level Stress_Level 
        Systolic_BP Diastolic_BP Heart_Rate Daily_Steps;
RUN;
```
The SAS MEANS procedure provides a summary of key statistical metrics for several health-related variables in the HEALTH.SLEEP_HEALTH dataset. 
- The average age of participants is 42, suggesting that the dataset includes a middle-aged demographic, with a moderate range of ages.
- participants report getting about 7 hours of sleep, which aligns with general sleep recommendations. The relatively small standard deviation indicates that most individuals are close to the average sleep duration.
- The average quality of sleep is fairly good (7.31), but the range indicates that some participants may experience poor sleep quality.
- The mean indicates a moderate level of physical activity, although the wide range suggests variability in activity levels among participants.
- An average stress level of 5.39 indicates a moderate level of stress among participants, with some experiencing low stress and others at higher levels.
- The average systolic BP is within a generally acceptable range, but it highlights the need for monitoring, especially for those at the higher end.
- The average diastolic BP is also within a normal range, although individuals on the higher end may require further evaluation.
- The average heart rate indicates a normal resting rate, with minimal variability among participants.
-  The average number of daily steps is below the recommended 10,000 steps for optimal health, suggesting an opportunity for increased physical activity among participants.

RUN;
```
**Gender Distribution**
- The gender distribution is nearly equal, with a slight male majority. This balance is important for generalizing findings across both genders in health analyses.
- The most common occupations include Doctor (18.98%) and Nurse (19.52%), indicating a strong representation of healthcare professionals, which may influence health outcomes and perceptions related to sleep and well-being.

**Occupational Distribution**
- Engineer (16.84%) and Lawyer (12.57%) also contribute significantly to the dataset.
- Manager and other roles show a low representation, suggesting a predominance of health-related professions.

**BMI Categories**
- The majority of participants fall into the Normal BMI category, followed by a significant portion classified as Overweight.
- The low percentage of Obese participants may suggest a generally healthy population but could also indicate potential health concerns related to weight management.

**Sleep Disorder Frequencies**
- A substantial majority report no sleep disorders (58.56%), while Insomnia and Sleep Apnea are reported by approximately equal portions of participants. The prevalence of insomnia and sleep apnea could suggest further investigation or intervention regarding sleep health.

```
/* Correlation analysis between key variables */
PROC CORR DATA=health.sleep_health;
    VAR Sleep_Duration Quality_of_Sleep Physical_Activity_Level Stress_Level Heart_Rate Daily_Steps;
RUN;
```
**Pearson Correlation Coefficients**
- The strongest correlations are found between sleep duration and quality of sleep (r = 0.88) and between stress levels and both sleep duration (r = -0.81) and quality of sleep (r = -0.90). This indicates that improving sleep duration can significantly enhance sleep quality, while managing stress is crucial for both sleep outcomes.
- There are moderate correlations between heart rate and sleep duration (r = -0.52), indicating that higher heart rates might negatively impact sleep duration.
- While physical activity level shows a positive correlation with sleep duration, it is weak (r = 0.21). This suggests that while increased activity may help improve sleep duration, other factors like stress and overall health might play a more significant role.
- The strong negative correlations between stress and both sleep quality and duration highlight the importance of stress management interventions in promoting better sleep health.
- Daily steps have a strong positive correlation with physical activity levels but show no significant correlation with sleep duration or quality. This suggests that simply walking more may not directly improve sleep health, although it contributes to overall physical activity.

/* Visualize the distribution of sleep duration by occupation */
PROC SGPLOT DATA=health.sleep_health;
    VBOX Sleep_Duration / CATEGORY=Occupation;
    TITLE 'Sleep Duration by Occupation';
RUN;
```
- The variation in sleep duration across occupations might reflect the nature of the job. For example, doctors and scientists show a wider range of sleep durations, possibly reflecting irregular schedules or demanding job requirements.
- Nurses tend to have a notably shorter median sleep duration, which could be indicative of shift work prevalent in healthcare.
- Sales Representatives and Scientists exhibit the most variability and outliers, suggesting less consistent sleep patterns possibly due to travel, deadlines, or the need for problem-solving at irregular hours.
- Managers and Lawyers, with their tightly grouped durations and higher medians, might have more regular schedules but also potentially longer hours that limit their sleep to a narrow but higher range.

/* Distribution of stress level across different BMI categories */
PROC SGPLOT DATA=health.sleep_health;
    VBOX Stress_Level / CATEGORY=BMI_Category;
    TITLE 'Stress Level by BMI Category';
RUN;
```
- Normal and Normal Weight categories show similar distributions, with medians around 5 and a fairly narrow interquartile range IQR, suggesting a moderate and consistent level of stress among individuals in these groups.
- Obese category shows a significantly higher median stress level, around 6.5, with a broader IQR extending from about 5 to 7.5. This indicates higher stress levels overall and greater variability in stress among obese individuals.
- Overweight individuals also exhibit higher stress levels with a median also close to 6.5. However, the spread (IQR) is slightly narrower compared to the obese category but still broader than the normal weight groups.

**The stress level tends to increase as the BMI category moves from normal to overweight and obese. This trend suggests a correlation between higher BMI and increased stress levels**.

**The similar stress distributions and medians in the Obese and Overweight categories might indicate that the factors contributing to stress are similar across these groups, potentially due to health-related issues, societal pressures, or psychological factors associated with being overweight or obese**.

### Recommendations
-  Offer specialized sleep hygiene programs for healthcare professionals, especially those in high-stress roles like doctors and nurses, to help manage the irregular schedules and demanding job requirements that negatively impact sleep.
-  Develop and implement stress reduction programs tailored to individuals with higher BMI, as stress levels are significantly correlated with increased BMI. These could include mindfulness, counseling, and other therapeutic strategies.
-  Regular Health Screenings: Emphasize the importance of regular screenings for blood pressure and heart rate, especially for individuals in the higher range, to prevent potential cardiovascular issues.
-  Establish comprehensive wellness programs that include stress management, opportunities for physical activity during work hours, and resources for mental health support.
-  Consider more flexible work arrangements to accommodate the need for adequate sleep, especially for shift workers like nurses and those with demanding travel schedules like sales representatives.
