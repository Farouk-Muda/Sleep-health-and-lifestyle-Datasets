### Overview
---

This dataset is designed to provide insights into how various lifestyle factors and health metrics influence sleep health. It provides a comprehensive set of variables related to an individualâ€™s daily habits, physical condition, and stress levels, aiming to explore the relationships between these factors and sleep duration, sleep quality, and overall well-being.

### Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is "Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv" file from Kaggle. The dataset contains 374 rows (individuals) and 8 columns (variables).

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```
/* Import the cleaned dataset */
libname Health "/home/u63989960/sasuser.v94/Health";

PROC IMPORT DATAFILE='/home/u63989960/sasuser.v94/Health/Sleep.csv'
    OUT=health.sleep_health
    DBMS=CSV
    REPLACE;
    GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;
proc print data=health.sleep_health; run;
