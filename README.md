### Overview
---

This dataset is designed to provide insights into how various lifestyle factors and health metrics influence sleep health. It provides a comprehensive set of variables related to an individualâ€™s daily habits, physical condition, and stress levels, aiming to explore the relationships between these factors and sleep duration, sleep quality, and overall well-being.

### Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is "[Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dnganhho/sleep-health)" file from Kaggle. The dataset contains 374 rows (individuals) and 8 columns (variables).

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```
/* Import the cleaned dataset */
libname Health "/home/u63989960/sasuser.v94/Health";

PROC IMPORT DATAFILE='/home/u63989960/sasuser.v94/Health/Sleep.csv'
    OUT=health.sleep_health
    DBMS=CSV
    REPLACE;
    GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;
proc print data=health.sleep_health; run;
```
The dataset was cleaned with Excel and imported into the SAS environment using the code above.You can view the entire dataset in SAS using the link below.

```
/* List variable names to verify the correct names in the dataset */
PROC CONTENTS DATA=health.sleep_health;
RUN;
```
The SAS CONTENTS procedure provides an overview of the HEALTH.SLEEP_HEALTH dataset. The data type variable has an associated length, format, and informat:
Numeric Variables: Age, Daily_Steps, Diastolic_BP, Heart_Rate, Person_ID, Physical_Activity_Level, Quality_of_Sleep, Sleep_Duration, Stress_Level, Systolic_BP are all numeric variables with a length of 8 bytes and a format of BEST12. or BEST32..
Character Variables: Gender (6 bytes), BMI_Category (13 bytes), Occupation (20 bytes), Sleep_Disorder (11 bytes) are character variables with different lengths and $ formats.

/* Summary statistics for numerical variables */
PROC MEANS DATA=health.sleep_health N MEAN STD MIN MAX;
    VAR Age Sleep_Duration Quality_of_Sleep Physical_Activity_Level Stress_Level 
        Systolic_BP Diastolic_BP Heart_Rate Daily_Steps;
RUN;
```
The SAS MEANS procedure provides a summary of key statistical metrics for several health-related variables in the HEALTH.SLEEP_HEALTH dataset. 
- The average age of participants is 42, suggesting that the dataset includes a middle-aged demographic, with a moderate range of ages.
- participants report getting about 7 hours of sleep, which aligns with general sleep recommendations. The relatively small standard deviation indicates that most individuals are close to the average sleep duration.
- The average quality of sleep is fairly good (7.31), but the range indicates that some participants may experience poor sleep quality.
- The mean indicates a moderate level of physical activity, although the wide range suggests variability in activity levels among participants.
- An average stress level of 5.39 indicates a moderate level of stress among participants, with some experiencing low stress and others at higher levels.
- The average systolic BP is within a generally acceptable range, but it highlights the need for monitoring, especially for those at the higher end.
- The average diastolic BP is also within a normal range, although individuals on the higher end may require further evaluation.
- The average heart rate indicates a normal resting rate, with minimal variability among participants.
-  The average number of daily steps is below the recommended 10,000 steps for optimal health, suggesting an opportunity for increased physical activity among participants.

/* Frequency counts for categorical variables */
PROC FREQ DATA=health.sleep_health;

RUN;
```
**Gender Distribution**
- The gender distribution is nearly equal, with a slight male majority. This balance is important for generalizing findings across both genders in health analyses.
- The most common occupations include Doctor (18.98%) and Nurse (19.52%), indicating a strong representation of healthcare professionals, which may influence health outcomes and perceptions related to sleep and well-being.

**Occupational Distribution**
- Engineer (16.84%) and Lawyer (12.57%) also contribute significantly to the dataset.
- Manager and other roles show a low representation, suggesting a predominance of health-related professions.

**BMI Categories**
- The majority of participants fall into the Normal BMI category, followed by a significant portion classified as Overweight.
- The low percentage of Obese participants may suggest a generally healthy population but could also indicate potential health concerns related to weight management.

**Sleep Disorder Frequencies**
- A substantial majority report no sleep disorders (58.56%), while Insomnia and Sleep Apnea are reported by approximately equal portions of participants. The prevalence of insomnia and sleep apnea could suggest further investigation or intervention regarding sleep health.
